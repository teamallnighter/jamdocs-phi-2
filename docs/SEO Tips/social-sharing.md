When creating content the goal is to drive up the seo score of the site and domain. 

Google doesn't normally rank Facebook, twitter or Instagram posts very high as there are too many. So, we want to create the post on the page and then share it to social media. This will ensure that the site has reputable back links and will help the page rank better.
