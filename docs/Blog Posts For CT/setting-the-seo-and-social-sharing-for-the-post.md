Here we can set up the SEO title and description for search engines. We want to ensure that our Title includes our target keyword. Make the title to the point and enticing for users. Avoid using similar titles to other posts and never use the same title twice. Look up supporting or alternate keywords for new posts. Search engines do not like duplicate data. 

For the description, again make sure this is unique and enticing. Include your target keyword and it will be bolded on search engines helping users see what the post is about quickly and easily.

For the social section, you are able to change the thumbnail shown on social media sites. This may come in handy if you for example, want the user to click on the link to see the end result.
